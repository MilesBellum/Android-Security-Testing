# Android Security Testing

This repository contains a collection of Frida scripts for performing security tests on Android applications. It includes a modular loader (`loader.js`) that facilitates the execution of multiple scripts simultaneously.

## üì¶ Modular Script Loader (`loader.js`)

The included `loader.js` dynamically loads all scripts inside the `/scripts/` directory, so you don‚Äôt need to manually include each one.

You can enable/disable specific scripts by modifying the loader array inside `loader.js`.
